# Identify-phishing-characteristics-in-a-suspicious-email-sample.

**Project Overview**

The task focuses on analyzing a potentially malicious email claiming that the user “won a Marriott Luxury Pillows 2-piece set.”
Through a structured eight-step methodology, various phishing indicators were identified, including spoofed sender information, mismatched domains, malicious links, header inconsistencies, and reward-based manipulation.

**What This Repository Includes**

Final Phishing Analysis Report (full-fledged detailed report)

Identified email metadata (sender, signed-by, mailed-by fields)

Suspicious link inspection

Breakdown of all phishing indicators

Summary of all red flags found

Security recommendations

**Skills Demonstrated**

Email header analysis

Sender authenticity verification

URL inspection and typosquatting detection

Phishing pattern recognition

Cybersecurity documentation and reporting

Practical awareness of social engineering tactics

**Key Findings**

The sender domain (*.pp.ua) was unrelated to Marriott.

Email headers revealed spoofing and unauthorized mail servers.

The embedded link (0peno1.store) was malicious and typosquatted.

The email used reward-based manipulation to lure victims.

Multiple technical indicators confirmed phishing intent.

**Outcome**

This analysis strengthens practical cybersecurity skills by demonstrating how to detect harmful email patterns, analyze header information, and verify authenticity before interacting with email content.
This repository can also serve as a reference for future phishing-analysis tasks and phishing-detection learning modules.
